# Telling-Stories-with-Data
Createing visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. 


# Project Description

In this project, I'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I did create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

# Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 
The file of data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

# Reminders
I use Tableau: other visualization tools may not be evaluated by reviewers. Host your dashboards/stories on Tableau Public.

# Files

A PDF or Markdown report that includes the following sections:
- Links to your dashboards or story
-  url links for each of my visuals from Tableau Public. 
- Summary: brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
